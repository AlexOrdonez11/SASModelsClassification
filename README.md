Here you will find an analysis of different prediction models for early dropout from a dataset of UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository

Be sure to check out the dataset.csv file and Variable Information.xlsm to have an overview of the used data.

To tun the SAS code make sure you have an account in SAS Studio, then import the dataset and change the file path to make it work.

Hope you can find interesting information in this project.
